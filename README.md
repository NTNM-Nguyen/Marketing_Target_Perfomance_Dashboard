# Term Deposits - telephonic marketing campaigns peformance

## Executive Summary

Telephonic marketing remains one of the most effective outreach channels, though it requires significant resources. Analysis shows that high-potential clients are aged 25–34, have annual balances of €0–5,000, work in management roles, are married, and have secondary education. Most successful conversions come from newly contacted clients or those contacted fewer than 21 times, and clients without other banking products (car or housing loans) are more likely to subscribe. May has the highest number of successful deposits, while March achieves the highest conversion rate. Customers who previously declined a term deposit rarely convert upon recontact, and cellular calls are the most effective communication method. Targeting these high-potential clients via cellular outreach can maximize campaign efficiency and conversions.
